XBRL_html.py uses XBRL tags in the html files downloaded from companies house

Each of these files is the company accounts of a company

Files are not consistent, and use different tags for y0 and y1 figures

In its current state, it needs to be ran 12 times on each folder of monthly reports. A version which ran through all 12 files was created, but my computer is not powerful enough to run in. Perhaps batch processing would help this, however for this alpha run this script is sufficient
